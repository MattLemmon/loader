Most of the images and sounds are from the public domain. But I'm not 100% positive about all of them.

I'm not sure if the fish is copyrighted. I pulled it from an animated gif.

Gosu and Chingu are subject to the MIT LICENSE, and the 
GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE (Version 2.1), respectively.
